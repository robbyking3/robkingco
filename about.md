Hi.

Rob King here, a web/interface designer in Victoria BC. 

I spend my days writing CSS, HTML, and Javascript, making scribbles on whiteboards and pixelating in Sketch. I believe in the utility of a living styleguide, keeping piles of CSS organized, and understanding the business value of each piece I build.

I'm looking for my next challenge, let's build something.
